          Stay tuned! We'll post questions here as we receive them. You can email us your questions at <a class="text-green" href="mailto:support@smarter.nj.gov?Subject=SmarterNJ%20Question">support@smarter.nj.gov</a>.</br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> Q: Can I speak with the Office of Innovation or with the panel of judges to ask questions about my idea? </b></br>
          A: You are welcome to email <a class="text-green" href="mailto:support@smarter.nj.gov">support@smarter.nj.gov</a> with specific questions, but, in the interests of fairness to all participants, 
          we're not able to speak with you about a specific proposal until the conclusion of Stage Two. The Office of Innovation also intends to host a webinar 
          with additional details about Stage Two in the coming weeks.</br>
        
          <i>Posted on 5/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> How comprehensive does an implementation plan have to be? Can we make suggestions short of a full implementation plan?</b></br>
          Please submit as complete an implementation plan as is possible for you to come up with given the time and information constraints you are under. 
          We understand that proposals may not be perfect, and that they may need to be tweaked if implemented, but we are looking for a plan that can be judged 
          as-is on the following criteria:
        <ul>
          <li>Quantifiable Impact</li>
          <li>Implementation Capacity</li>
          <li>Rapid Implementation Feasibility</li>
          <li>Proposal Completeness</li>
        </ul>
        Please see the Stage Two evaluation criteria on <a class="text-green" href="https://www.smarter.nj.gov/enjine/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for more information. 

      </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>


          <b class="text-green"> Why can a participant submit a plan to Stage Two for an idea that they did not come up with?  </b></br>
          The skills required to come up with a feasible and impactful idea are different from the skills required to craft an implementation strategy. 
          Those who submitted compelling Stage One ideas may or may not have the same strengths as those who submit a Stage Two plan that is detailed and complete.
           The two stages of the challenge are designed to highlight the work of State employees who have each of those critical strengths.
          </br><i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green">If there is an existing policy or procedure that the State could potentially adopt, can I suggest that as my implementation plan?
            </b></br>
            While you are welcome to suggest a policy or practice that has been implemented before, please see Stage Two evaluation criteria on 
            <a class="text-green" href="https://www.smarter.nj.gov/enjine/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a>
             for more information on how your plan will be judged. It is important that, in addition to suggesting an existing idea, you describe specifically 
             how the State could scale it and make it work.
            
            </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> Is the Stage Two Implementation plan submission form considered to be the "Implementation Plan," or are we able to attach a 
            separate formal Implementation Plan document to the Stage Two questions?
          </b></br>
          You may use the appendix section of your plan for further research, data, or any other details that you would like to include. What you write in the 
          submission form should cover the important broader questions about why and how your plan would work.
         
        </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green">Why do you ask for participants’ resumes to be attached to an implementation plan?</b></br>
          Implementation plans will be judged solely on the strength of their content. We request resumes not to evaluate your submission, but rather to 
          understand 1) what skills and expertise you might bring if your plan were implemented, and 2) what additional skills or expert advising we would need 
          to seek to bring your plan to fruition.</br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> Can a person who came up with a winning Stage One idea join a Stage Two team who submits an implementation plan with that idea?</b></br>
          Yes. If you came up with a winning Stage One idea, you’re welcome to be part of a Stage Two plan working on a plan for that idea if all of the team 
          members agree upon this formation. 
          
        </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> Are the word limits on the submission form strict, or am I okay as long as my plan does not unreasonably exceed the limit?
            </b></br>
            You will not be disqualified for exceeding the exact word limit if your submission is of a reasonable length. However, please be mindful of the fact 
            that a small panel of judges is reading submissions one by one—it is in your best interests to be concise where possible.
          </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green">Are there any financial prizes for the winners? </b></br>
          No, the individuals or teams with the winning plans will: 
         <ul>
         <li> Receive expert advising and support to realize their plans; and </li>
          <li>Be recognized at a special awards ceremony with the Governor.</li>
        </ul>
      </br> <i>Posted on 6/14/2019</i></br></br>

          <b class="text-green"> Can an implementation plan deviate from the Stage One idea on which it is based?</b></br>
          You're welcome to submit a variation on a Stage One idea as your implementation plan.
