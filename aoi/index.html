    <h1>BIG HEALTH DATA</h1>

  </div>

  <div class="intro-text">
    <h2>WHAT IS<br>BIG HEALTH DATA?</h2>
    <p>Big health data refers to the ability to gather and analyze large quantities of information about health,
      wellness and lifestyle. Big health data includes information from health care providers as well as data from
      sources such
      as apps that track our sleep and exercise habits and the purchases we make.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Doctors, healthcare organizations,
      insurance companies, financial service providers, product and service companies, and governments at every level
      are
      keen to use such data.</p>
    <h2>The Good News?</h2>
    <p>Increasing the use and sharing of data could enable better diagnoses, more targeted prevention and treatments,
      faster research and cures, the creation of new tools to help us make healthier choices, and economic growth from
      the creation of health data businesses.</p>
    <h2>The Bad News?</h2>
    <p>The collection, sharing, and use of big health data could reveal sensitive personal information over which we
      have little control. This data could be sold without our consent. It could be used by entities for surveillance or
      discrimination, rather than to promote well-being. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="survey-section" class="text-box-white">
    <h2>YOUR VOICE MATTERS. AARP WANTS TO HEAR FROM YOU!</h2>
    <p>The ideas below are opportunities and challenges arising from the greater use of data in healthcare. AARP wants
      to know what you think about how health data should be used and protected. </p><br>
    <p>Share your opinions and help us learn
      the priorities of people 50 and older when it comes to big health data. We will use this information to inform our
      thinking and to serve as the basis for developing solutions that can address challenges and take advantage of
      opportunities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You will be presented with a series of two-option questions. Tell us which, between the two options, is your
      greater concern. These options might be dangers from the use of data or from the failure to use data.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Answer as many (or as few) two-option questions as you likeâ€¦or add your own option! The more you tell us, the better we can
      understand the possible challenges of big health data together.</p>
