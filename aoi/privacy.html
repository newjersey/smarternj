        <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p> 
        
          This <a href="https://crowd.law">CrowdLaw</a> platform is brought to you by <a href="https://thegovlab.org">The Governance Lab</a> at New York University ("The GovLab") on behalf of AARP. CrowdLaw is the practice of using technology to involve the public in a law or policymaking process.

          It is one of many examples of institutions turning to new technology to create a two-way conversation and bring more voices into decision making.
          The software we are using is called <a href="http://allourideas.org">All Our Ideas</a>. It was designed by <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/">Professor Matthew Salganik</a> of Princeton University. This version of All Our Ideas is hosted by The GovLab. All Our Ideas is powered by open source software and free for your use and re-use. Also, you can use the All Our Ideas API to create your own pairwise comparison site.

        <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
        <p>You do not need to register to respond to the survey. You may vote on questions anonymously. All visitors to the site will have their IP address geolocated using a publicly available database for purposes of showing you the location of participants. We do not store IP addresses in our database. Instead, we store your approximate location, as inferred from your IP address, and a cryptographic hash of your IP address in our database. We may also use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to track traffic on the website. Further, like most websites, we use cookies to enhance your experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to our website. Please refer to the "do we use cookies?" section below for information about cookies and how we use them.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or use information about how an individual voted. Rather, we collect and use aggregate and anonymous data for research purposes. We are interested in broad patterns not in how any one particular person voted. So, for example, we are interested in the average number of votes cast in each session, but we are not interested in identifying who picked which response.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. In order to offer you a better site experience, we use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic.</p>
        
        <h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
        <p>Aggregated results (e.g. results of a given survey) are publicly visible to you and the world. Click on the "View Results" tab in the tool to see those results.
        
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.</p>
        
        <h2>Third party links</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include links to third party websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
        
        <h2>Web servers</h2>
        <p>Our web servers are provided by Digital Ocean. You can read Digital Ocean's Legal and Security policy <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/">here</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to change our privacy policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Please periodically check this section to review the current version of the Privacy Policy. </p>
