<b class="text-green">WHO CAN APPLY? </b></br>
The Innovation ENJINE Challenge is open to all New Jersey State employees of executive branch departments, as well as
those of select commissions and agencies. For a list of participating entities, click <a
href="https://smarter.nj.gov/enjine/participating.html"
target="_blank">here</a>.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">CAN I SUBMIT MORE THAN ONE IDEA? </b></br>
You can submit as many ideas for Stage One as you like. For Stage Two, an individual should only be a part of one
submission.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT AN IDEA FOR STAGE ONE? </b></br>
No. Participation is 100% optional. You can vote for Stage One ideas regardless of whether you submitted an
idea.
Also, you can participate in a Stage Two implementation team even if you did not submit an idea for Stage
One.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">IF I SUBMIT A WINNING IDEA IN STAGE ONE, CAN I COMPETE IN STAGE TWO?
</b></br>
Yes, you can write an implementation plan for your own idea or someone else’s idea in Stage
Two.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TEAM AND WHO SELECTS THE MEMBERS?</b> </br>
Teams for Stage Two are self-organizing. You can find colleagues in your own department or in others to form a team. No
more than six people can participate on a single team.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT FOR STAGE ONE? </b></br>
For the idea stage, you will need to fill out a brief questionnaire at enjine.smarter.nj.gov that asks what your idea
is, what
problem it solves, what your solution is, and what the anticipated impact
is.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT FOR THE STAGE TWO?</b> </br>
For the implementation stage, each team will need to submit a long form-questionnaire. Details will be available at
smarter.nj.gov.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">CAN I PARTICIPATE ONLY IN STAGE ONE AND NOT STAGE TWO?</b> </br>
Yes.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">FOR STAGE TWO, CAN I DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ON MY OWN, OR DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT AS PART OF
A TEAM?</b> </br>
You can submit an implementation plan independently. You are not required to be a part of a
team.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">IF I DON’T SUBMIT AN IDEA, CAN I STILL VOTE ON THEM? </b></br>
Yes. Any government employee eligible to participate can vote on ideas.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT ARE THE SUBMISSION DEADLINES?</b> </br>
Stage One responses are due on April 7th. Stage Two responses are due on May
12th.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT DO I GET IF I WIN STAGE ONE?</b> </br>
If you submitted an idea that is one of the top 20 for Stage One, you will be showcased on the SmarterNJ website, be
recognized in an awards ceremony, receive a certificate of achievement, and have your idea advance to the next
stage.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT DO I GET IF I WIN STAGE TWO?</b> </br>
If you or your team submit a winning plan, you will receive expert advising and support for implementation, and you
will get to participate in a special ceremony with the Governor.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">WHAT IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON SUBMITS A SIMILAR IDEA? </b></br>
We will not eliminate similar submissions. Although some ideas may be similar, they will be expressed differently in
your own, original words.</br></br>

<b class="text-green">CAN I USE A STATE COMPUTER OF MOBILE DEVICE TO SUBMIT AN IDEA OR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN?</b>
</br>
Yes.</br></br>
