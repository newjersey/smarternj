      <p>As part of our Administration's commitment to bring New Jersey government into the 21st century and make the Garden State a leader in innovation, we must tap into the
        State's greatest asset - its people. As a state employee, you have one of the best perspectives of the challenges we face, and the knowledge, expertise, and insights
        we need to solve those challenges. We are now requesting your ideas to improve state government. Your submissions should focus on tangible outcomes that result in one or more of the following outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Direct cost-savings for the State;</li>
          <li>A more efficient process that results in a reduction of staff time; or</li>
          <li>A more effective outcome that increases the positive impact of an existing service or program</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="font-weight: 900;"><span style="border-bottom: 4px solid #609e09">CHALLENGE PROCESS</h3>
      <p>ENJINE is a two-stage challenge. In Stage One, employees submit their ideas and vote on one another's submissions. The twenty most impactful and implementable short proposals, as rated by you, will advance to Stage Two.
      For Stage Two, all employees are invited to compete - either as individuals or in teams - by crafting a plan for how to implement one of the twenty advancing ideas.
      A panel of expert judges will select up to five winning teams. Those teams will receive expert support to actually implement their plans.</p>
      <h3 style="font-weight: 900;"><span style="border-bottom: 4px solid #609e09">ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE</h3>
