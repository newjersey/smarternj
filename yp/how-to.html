       <b> <span style="border-bottom: 4px solid #609e09">HOW TO ADD AN IDEA:</span></b> adding an idea is easy! Once you log in, just click the "Add New Idea" button, fill out the form that pops up, click "Next", add any media (an image, a video, or even a recording) you would like to, 
        and then click "Create". That's it!</p>

        <p><span style="border-bottom: 4px solid #609e09"><b>HOW TO VOTE:</span> </b>you can vote for as many ideas as you like. Once you log in, all you need to do is click the "thumbs up" icon on a specific idea to cast your votes. 
         Remember, votes should be cast based on an idea's impact and feasibility:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Impact:</b> How large is the potential impact of the proposed idea? Impact could be measured in terms of the money or staff time saved and/or the number of people, agencies, 
                    or departments that are positively impacted.</li>
                <li><b>Feasibility:</b> How feasible is it to potentially implement a proposed idea? Feasibility could be measured in terms of how likely it is that a proposed idea could be implemented, 
                    how much staff time would be required to implement it, or whether laws or regulations would need to change.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        
        <p><span style="border-bottom: 4px solid #609e09"><b>HOW TO COMMENT:</span> </b>you can comment on an idea's impact and feasibility, or you can highlight challenges or make suggestion about an idea. To do this, just click on a 
        specific idea, and on the next screen, scroll down to the debate section to add comments. REMEMBER: everything you post is public, and associated with your name - be thoughtful, 
        supportive, and professional. </p>
