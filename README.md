### SmarterNJ 

[SmarterNJ](https://smarter.nj.gov) is an open government initiative that uses new and innovative technology to meaningfully engage New Jerseyans. Participation allows us to create policies, programs and services that are more effective, efficient, and impactful for all New Jerseyans. The first initiative, [Enjine](https://smarter.nj.gov/enjine), solicits ideas from NJ State employees to improve how our government operates and serves the public. 

### Office of Innovation + Lab

SmarterNJ was developed by the New Jersey Office of Innovation + Lab in collaboration with [Your Priorities](https://www.yrpri.org) and colleagues across the State. If you're interested in joining us to improve the way the NJ government delivers services to New Jerseyans, please [reach out](mailto:innovation@tech.nj.gov)!
